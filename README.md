## KitScript - A User Script Manager For Safari

**KitScript** is an open source Safari Extension developed by Seraf Dos Santos and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/Syr3f/KitScript).

The project was started in the fall of 2011 and was/is mainly inspired by the defunct (or no more maintained) User Script Safari Extensions/Add-Ons: *GreaseKit* &amp; *NinjaKit*.

The open source **[KitScript](https://syr3fgithub.com/KitScript)** project has a main objective to be developed and thouroughly maintained by the community and is always looking for participants for its development and maintenance.

For any bugs, [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Syr3f/KitScript/issues). We're always welcoming pull requests also, keep them coming.

Enjoy!
